# Blackjack Advisor

The project file you will need to run this program is called blackjack_advisor.rb.  

The program was designed to run through the terminal using ruby.

This project contains a README file and the project file blackjack_advisor.rb.

The program is intended to help users to optimize their profits during a game of blackjack by providing both the player's card values and the dealer's card value.

Please complete the following process to run this program properly:
  1. Open terminal.
  2. Change your directory (cd) to the one that which you have saved this zip file.
  3. Type ruby blackjack_advisor.rb
  4. READ the instructions before adding input.



Note - some bugs currently found in code as of 9/15/16:
Sometimes the code will tell the user to hit, when it is more than obvious the user should stand.  This occurs for all methods.
The output will tell the user both strategies for playing a hard hand and playing pairs due to the methods called.  
All bugs are in progress of being fixed.  I appreciate your patience and feedback.  Thank you for using my program.  Enjoy!
